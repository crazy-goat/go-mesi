# mESI command

A command-line interface (CLI) tool for experimenting with and testing ESI (Edge Side Includes) functionality. 
This CLI is built on top of the [go-mesi](https://github.com/crazy-goat/go-mesi/tree/cli) library, which extends Goâ€™s HTTP capabilities for ESI parsing and rendering.

## Overview

The `mesi-cli` is designed to demonstrate how the [go-mesi](https://github.com/crazy-goat/go-mesi/tree/cli) library works and to provide developers with a straightforward way to:

1. Parse ESI markup in HTML documents.
2. Render or simulate server-side fragment assembly.
3. Test and debug ESI-related workflows.

This tool helps those new to ESI or the `go-mesi` library understand how to process ESI tags, retrieve fragments, and integrate them into one or more assembled pages.

## Features

- **ESI Tag Parsing**: Parses standard ESI tags (e.g., `<esi:include>`).
- **Local & Remote Fragment Retrieval**: Supports retrieving fragments from local file paths or remote URLs.
- **Command-Line Oriented**: Offers a simple CLI interface for quick tests without requiring a full web server environment.

## Installation

**Clone this repository** (or download it):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crazy-goat/go-mesi.git
cd go-mesi/cli
make
```

## Usage
Basic Commands
Run the mesi-cli binary followed by the command and any required arguments:

```shell
mesi-cli [options] path/url
```

**Flags**
- **default-url <url>** (string): Specifies the default URL to parse when no explicit source is provided. Default: http://127.0.0.1/
- **max-depth <depth>** (integer): Defines the maximum depth of parsing, which can limit how many nested ESI includes or references are processed. Default: 5
- **timeout <seconds>** (float): Sets the request timeout duration (in seconds) for all retrieval operations. Default: 10.0
- **parse-on-header** (bool): Enables ESI parsing on the HTTP headers, if set to `true` response must have `Edge-control: dca=esi` to enable parsing. Default: false

## Example Usage
Render an ESI-enabled HTML from a file:
```shell
mesi-cli ./examples/simple.html
```
This command will parse index.html for ESI tags, fetch any fragments, and then write the assembled document to stdout.


Render an ESI-enabled HTML from a remote source:
```shell
 ./mesi-cli https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crazy-goat/go-mesi/refs/heads/main/examples/index.html
```
This will fetch an HTML page with [simple example](../examples/index.html), parse its ESI tags, retrieve fragments (either remote or local), and save the rendered output to stdout.
